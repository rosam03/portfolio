	<div class="content aboutme">

		<p> I pursued a degree in engineering because I love solving complex problems and creating unique solutions to issues that haven't been solved before.</br> </br>

			When I started my Bachelor of Applied Science (BASC) at the University of British Columbia, all students were enrolled in a general engineering curriculum. We were required to take a first year programming course, which is where I fell in love and knew what I would be doing for the rest of my life. There was something about understanding the abstraction that goes on in computer systems and applications that intrigued me. I thought it was so cool that I could give the computer some instructions and see it turn into something real. It was then that I realized how powerful programming could be.</br> </br>

			My interest is regardless of context; I love learning new things which is why I'm interested in a career in various parts of computer engineering. Whether it be the cars we drive or the apps we use to keep in touch with friends and family, I want to use my skills to make a difference in people's lives.</br> </br>

			I am graduating May 2018 with a BASC in Computer Engineering at UBC. My past work experiences include web application development and web application security analysis. </p>
